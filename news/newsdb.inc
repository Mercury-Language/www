"We've added some extra syntax to the language to support programming
with `state variables'.  State variables are intended to make it easier
to deal with sequences of values.  For example, where previously one
would have to name each value in a sequence X0, X1, X2, ..., X, now it
is possible to use a state variable !X, which will be translated into
ordinary, non-state variable Mercury, automatically naming the sequence
values.  !X stands for two arguments, !.X and !:X, where !.X is
interpreted as the \"current\" sequence value under consideration and !:X
is taken as the \"next\" sequence value.  State variable syntax should be
used in preference to DCG notation for threading the IO state in future.

more details."
