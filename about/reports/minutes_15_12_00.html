We had a meeting of the Mercury group on Fri Dec 15,
from 3:10pm to about 5:00pm.

Attendees:
	Adrian Pellas-Rice <apell>
	Thomas Conway <conway>
	David Jeffery <dgj>
	Fergus Henderson <fjh>
	Ina Cheng <inch>
	Julien Fischer <juliensf>
	Kevin Glynn <keving>
	Levi Cameron <lpcam>
	Sam Thurairatnam <sthur>
	Tyson Dowd <trd>
	Simon Mei <xcsm>
	Zoltan Somogyi <zs>

1. Progress reports.

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing what
	they had been working on recently and/or what they were planning
	to work on.

	Tyson Down <trd>:

		- Helping summer students.

		- Continuing work on the Managed C++ implementation of the
		  standard library.  Progress is fairly slow.

		- Got MCORBA working in hlc.par.gc grade.
		  (This is particularly useful because the asm_fast.gc.par
		  grade is broken, at least on Linux.)

		- Fix a bug with printing of tuples.
	
		- Learnt about XML and SOAP.

	Fergus Henderson <fjh>:

		- Added trail support for the MLDS back-end.

		- Fixed a problem with `:- external' in the MLDS back-end.

		- Set up automated tests for the various MLDS grades
		  (on the machine `roy').
		
		- Spent half a day working on the Java back-end with
		  Julien Fischer.

		- Spent some time talking with Simon Mei about RTTI
		  and how to generate arbitrary user-defined data types.

	At this point we digressed into a discussion about the RTTI
	support.  Zoltan asked if DJ had some outstanding stuff with
	regard to the RTTI interface, and DJ replied that he didn't.
	There was some discussion about cleaning up the RTTI interface:
	- moving the RTTI stuff from std_util.m into a separate module
	- moving the stuff with a Prolog-like interface into prolog.m
	- adding type class constraints on some of the RTTI operations
	- improving the documentation
	But no-one is currently working on this.  In any case it
	should not be in the "Rudolph" release.

	Levi Cameron <lpcam>:

		- More work on the bytecode interpreter.

		- Working on if-then-elses, disjunctions, and commits

	Simon Mei <xcsm>:

		- More work on the ``quickcheck''-style test generator.

		- Had previously been using typeclasses and instance
		  declarations, but was now instead using RTTI and nested
		  if-then-elses with dynamic type checks (type_to_univ).

		- Fergus mentioned that it would have been nice if
		  we had dynamic type class casts so that these two
		  techniques could be combined

	Adrian Pellas-Rice <apell>:
		
		- Working on sequence quantification

		Fergus gave a brief explanation of sequence quantification
		for the rest of the Mercury group:

			The problem that sequence quantification is aimed
			at addressing is that there is no way of writing
			loops in Mercury without using explicit recursion
			or higher-order code, both of which are conceptually
			somewhat complicated. 

			Sequence quantification adds a new kind of goal:

				forall Var1 in Seq1
				    as Var2 in Seq2
				    as Var3 in Seq3
				    ...
				    Goal

			This essentially just univiersally quantifies the
			sequence over all corresponding elements in the
			given sequences.
			The declarative semantics of this can be given by

				all [I] (
				    (Var1 = Seq1 ^ elem(I),
				     Var2 = Seq2 ^ elem(I),
				     Var3 = Seq3 ^ elem(I))
				=>
				    Goal
				)

			where `Seq ^ elem(I)' is field accessor syntax
			for a type class method call; `elem' is a method
			of some `sequence' type class that gets the `I'th
			element of the sequence.

			However, operationally, the idea is that the compiler
			will instead transform this into a call to a
			recursive predicate.

			That's the simple version; there are also some more
			complicated extensions possible, including in
			particular `initially ... finally ...' sequences,
			which are goals of the form

				forall Var1 in Seq1
				    as Var2 initially Initial finally Final
				    ...
				    Goal

			where Goal can refer to `next Var2'.
			The declarative semantics of this can be defined as

				forall Var1 in Seq1
				    as Var2 in [Initial] ++ Accs
				    as NextVar2 in Accs ++ [Final]
				    ...
				    Goal [with `next Var2'
				    replaced by `NextVar2']

			where `NextVar2' and `Accs' are both fresh variables.
			i.e.

				all [I] (
				    (Var1 = Seq1 ^ elem(I),
				     Var2 = ([Initial] ++ Accs) ^ elem(I),
				     NextVar2 = (Accs ++ [Final]) ^ elem(I))
				=>
				    Goal
				)
			
			For example:

				:- func sum(list(int)) = int.
				sum(L) = Sum :-
					forall X in L
					    as Acc initially 0 finally Sum
					    next Acc = Acc + X.

			The modes allowed for sequence quantification
			are more general than what is allowed for
			universal quantification in Mercury.
			Universal quantifications can't have any
			outputs.  But for sequence quantification we
			can handle the modes by using mode inference
			for the generated recursive predicate, which
			will allow `forall' goals to produce outputs.

			Zoltan said it was not good to rely on mode
			inference, since the modes would then depend
			on the order of the conjuncts in <Goal>.

			Tyson suggested that we could allow optional
			explicit mode annotations on forall goals, i.e.

				forall <Var1> in (<Seq1>::in)
				    as <Var2> in (<Seq2>::in)
				    as <Var3> in (<Seq3>::out)
				    ...
				    <Goal>

		The general consensus was that this proposal for sequence
		quantification seemed like a good idea.

		- Adrian has been working on adding the new stuff needed
		  to the parse tree representation (prog_data.m) and
		  to the HLDS goal representation (hlds_goal.m).
		  A new HLDS goal type is required because the transformation
		  needs to know the non-local variables, which are computed
		  by the quantification pass, which works on the HLDS.
		  After quantification the transformation can be applied,
		  so the later passes will not need to handle this goal;
		  they can just call error/1, like they do for bi_implication.

		  Fergus suggested that if someone adds a third such goal
		  which gets syntactically expanded away after quantification,
		  we should combine all three into a single alternative
		  goal type called e.g. `syntactic_sugar/1', so that number
		  of clauses calling error/1 remains small.  Someone
		  (Zoltan?) said that it would be better and also
		  easier to do this now.  Everyone agreed.

	Thomas Conway <conway>:

		- Back for a two-month "do or die" effort on his thesis.

		- Spent some time chatting with summer students

		- Asked about including the new namespace stuff for the XML
		  package in the release.  Fergus said the deadline for new
		  features expired a week ago, so unless it was completely
		  ready, it should not go in the new release.  Tyson suggested
		  making a release of the XML stuff as a separate package,
		  sometime after the compiler release, and just making sure
		  that it was compatible with the compiler release.

		- Has been working with Zoltan on a paper on deep profiling.

	Ina Cheng <inch>:

		- working on sending SOAP messages through the web server

		- looking at the XML package
	
		- started adding support for XML namespaces

	Sam Thurairatnam <sthur>:

		- Has been working on improving the pretty printer.

		- Adding suppport for limiting size of printed terms
		  based on the number of lines and characters (rather
		  than the depth, etc.)
		
		- Zoltan has written some code which takes a term and
		  returns a term annotated with size information,
		  and Sam is writing some code which takes such an
		  annotated term and produces a `pprint:doc' type.

	Julien Fischer <juliensf>:
		
		- Working on the Java back-end

		- Output arguments now work.  We've implemented those
		  by returning an array of objects.

		- User-defined types are not quite working

		- Tyson asked about other features: exceptions, switches, RTTI?
		  Julien was not sure whether they work.
		  Fergus suggested that Julien should start making a list
		  of which features work and which don't.

	Kevin Glynn <keving>:

		- Has applied for a six-month extension

	David Jeffery <dgj>:

		- Has been working on his thesis

		- Did some work on MCORBA

		- Anthony Senyard <anthls> has been working on a
		  project involving using CORBA to connect some Mercury
		  code which produces a graph with a package that does
		  force feedback graph visualization.  Very cool ;-)

	Zoltan Somogyi <zs>:

		- Fixed four bugs in retry

		- Has been working on a deep profiling paper with Tom.

		- Has been dealing with exam students

2. Hardware issues

We discussed some issues about disk space, nightly bootchecks,
the new file server, etc.

We should schedule one night on which we don't run any bootchecks
to ensure we can get a clean backup.

3. Release plans

Tyson's changes to add support for managed C++ version of the
library will take some time.  Zoltan's retry fixes and changes to the
configure options should be ready tonight.  There are no other changes
outstanding (though there are a few bugs that should still be fixed).

Fergus will fork off a release branch in the next day or so, once
Zoltan's two outstanding changes have been committed.  Tyson will
commit his stuff onto the release branch when it is ready.
