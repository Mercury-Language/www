1. New team member

	A welcome to Ralph Becket, who recently joined the Mercury team
	in Melbourne.

2. Progress reports

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs):
		- Worked on stack slot optimization:
			- correct code is generated for tree234__search,
			  the motivating example;
			- currently fixing a problem in the interaction
			  with code generation.
		- Refereeing papers.

	David Overton (dmo):
		- Worked on the mode constraints paper.
		- Fixed a bug in mode analysis.
		- More work on default modes for higher-order code,
		  responding to Fergus' review comments.

	Simon Taylor (stayl):
		- More work on moving mmake functionality into the compiler.
		- Fixed a bug in record syntax.
		- Added version identifiers to the texinfo files.

	Ralph Becket (rafe):
		- Has been setting up his working environment on the local
		  machines.
		- Spent some time becoming more familiar with the compiler
		  source.
		- Has started planning for a Mercury tutorial book.

	Mark Brown (dougl):
		- Worked on another draft of the declarative debugging paper.
		- Read several debugging related papers which were presented
		  at the conferences recently attended by Fergus.

	Tyson Dowd (trd):
		- Arrived back in Melbourne and started work on Tuesday.
		- Reported on the work he had done while away, including:
			- foreign language improvements, with foreign types
			  (on the foreign branch);
			- improvements to arrays;
			- RTTI;
			- unify and compare in Mercury;
			- improving the organisation of assemblies and
			  submodules.

3. System upgrade

	Debian on hydra has been upgraded to 'testing'.

4. Bug installing releases-of-the-day

	Zoltan reported a bug in the automatically built ROTDs, which did
	not have some required files for the deep profiler.  The problem is
	that they are built on murlibobo, for which deep profiling is not
	enabled.  ROTDs will now be built on one of the Debian systems,
	such as venus or mars.
