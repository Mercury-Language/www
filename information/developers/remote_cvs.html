<h2>Using the CVS client to remotely access the Mercury CVS archive</h2>

Author: Tyson Dowd -- trd@cs.mu.oz.au 
<p>

Almost all work in the Mercury project is under revision control using
CVS.  The sources, documentation, test-cases, webpages and samples
are all stored under various modules of the CVS repository on
filesystems here at the University of Melbourne. CVS allows
client-server access to this repository. This document describes how
to use the CVS archive remotely.
<p>

You need:
<ul>
	<li> A version of CVS with client server support (1.9 works fine)
	  installed at the remote end. Probably anything newer than
	  1.5 will work OK.
	<li> A TCP/IP connection to the Internet.
</ul>

Anonymous Access:
<ul>
	<li> The CVS server is running on <b>cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au</b>,
	and the
	repository is in the directory <b>/home/mercury/mercury1/repository</b>
	<li> The anonymous access account is called <i>guest</i> with a
		password of <i>guest</i>
	<li> To login (you need to do this just once)
<pre>
	cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au:/home/mercury/mercury1/repository login
</pre>
	<li> The password is <i>guest</i>
	<li> To checkout a module 
<pre>
	cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au:/home/mercury/mercury1/repository checkout mercury
</pre>
	<li> There is a list of modules later in this page.

	<li> You will have read-only access to the repository.  If you
	want to commit something you will need to get someone with
	read-write access to do it for you.  If you send your patch to
	the mercury-developers mailing list you should be able to get
	this done.

	<li> You almost certainly want to add the following lines to
	your .cvsrc (in your home directory).

<pre>
	cvs -z6
	diff -u -N
	update -Pd
</pre>

	<li> This turns on compression in client/server transfers, uses
	the preferred Mercury diff format (unified diff with new files
	shown as diffs), prunes empty directories and picks up new
	directories.

	<li> Please remember that if you want to track the latest
	releases, you may run into incompatibility problems unless you
	update very regularly.  The Mercury compiler often relies on a
	very recent version of the Mercury compiler to build from
	scratch.  If you get out of date, it might be worth downloading
	the latest release-of-the-day and installing it.
</ul>

Getting Write Access:
<ul>
	<li> The preferred method for remote write access to the CVS repository
	is through ssh (using version 2 of the ssh protocol) using public key
	authentication.
	You will need to install an ssh client on your machine if you do not
	already have one.

	<li> If you do not have an ssh version 2 key pair on your machine you
	will need to generate one using
	<pre>
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	</pre>

	<li> Send your public key <tt>.ssh/id_rsa.pub</tt> to a member of the
	Mercury team and get them to do the following steps:
	
	<ol>
		<li>
			Create an account for the new user on
			cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au (a.k.a jupiter).
			The password field in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> should
			contain only an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>)
			to prevent the user logging in.
			A good place for the user's home directory
			is <tt>/home/jupiter/<i>username</i></tt>.
		</li>
		<li> Create a file <tt>.ssh/authorized_keys</tt> in the
			user's home directory and add the user's public key to
			that file.  The key should be all on one line, and at
			the start of the line you should add the string
			<pre>
	command="cvs server",no-port-forwarding
			</pre>
			This prevents the user from doing anything with their
			account except using the CVS server.
	</ol>

	<li> 
	Access via Windows should work just fine.  Most firewalls are
	  setup to allow ssh access through.  You can get a free
	  binary (and source) CVS for Windows from 
	  <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/">www.cyclic.com</a>.
	  Also there is a product called 
	  <a href="http://www.wincvs.com/">WinCVS</a> that should
	  work (although we haven't tried it ourselves).
	  CVS and OpenSSH are also both included in
	  <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.
</ul>

Then (once your account is set up):
<ul>

	<li> Set your CVSROOT environment variable to
	<pre>
	:ext:username@cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au:/home/mercury/mercury1/repository
	</pre>
	  Make sure this environment variable is exported (in sh
	  based shells, "export CVSROOT", in csh based shells, use
	  "setenv" to set the environment variable in the first place).

	<li>  Set your CVS_RSH environment variable to "ssh".

	<li> There are some checks that are done via questions.
	In particular, our CVS repository does checks for up-to-date copyright
	messages on all files.
	For remote users this requires an X connection so you will probably want
	to turn on X forwarding by adding the following to your
	<tt>~/.ssh/config</tt> file:
	<pre>
	Host cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au
	ForwardX11 yes
	</pre>
	If you are not running an X server and you are having problems
	committing changes because of this, please contact us.

	<li> You can do "cvs co mercury" to check out the main mercury
	  module. This can take a while over a slow connection, but you
	  should see pretty steady progress messages, eg:
	  <pre>
	  	U mercury/.INSTALL.in
		U mercury/.README.in
		U mercury/.cvsignore
		U mercury/BUGS
		U mercury/COPYING
		U mercury/COPYING.LIB
		etc
	  </pre>

	<li> The CVS modules you might need access to are:
		<dl>
	  	<dt>mercury	<dd> the mercury compiler, runtime, library,
				  extras and documentation (big)
	  	<dt>mercury-gcc	<dd> the mercury-gcc distribution;
				  this contains part of the source for the
				  <a href="http://www.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au/download/gcc-backend.html">native code
				  back-end</a>
	  	<dt>tests	<dd> test cases for the compiler (big)
		<dt>w3		<dd> the www page (several Mb - lots of papers)
		</dl>

	  CVS should compress most of this stuff while sending it.
</ul>

NOTE:
<ul>
	<li> All developers should subscribe to the mercury-developers
	  mailing list.  Serious developers should also subscribe to the
	  mercury-reviews mailing list,
	  to keep up-to-date on development discussion, and 
	  to be able to participate in discussions about code they
	  want to change.  The mercury-developers list is a forum to ask
	  questions about how to change something, discuss design trade-offs,
	  and report on any development that you suspect will influence others.
	  The mercury-reviews list is used for posting and reviewing diffs,
	  although it often also contains design discussions about issues
	  that have arisen during code review.
	  (Traffic on mercury-reviews is moderately high - between
	  100 and 300 messages per month, so you should filter into
	  a separate folder if possible).

	<li> Before committing any code, read the policy on reviews for the
	  Mercury system. This can be found in the mercury CVS
	  module:
	  <ul>
	  	<li> mercury/compiler/notes/reviews.html
	  </ul>
	  or
	  <ul>
	  	<li>on the <a href="http://www.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au/information/doc-latest/reviews.html">web</a>
	  </ul>
	  Basically, we don't commit broken code into the repository,
	  and we don't commit un-reviewed code.

	<li> You'll need to be familiar with CVS to keep up to date with
	  the development tree. If you haven't used it before, read the
	  info pages on CVS and the documentation that comes with it.
	  There is a free book on CVS at 
	  <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">cvsbook.red-bean.com</a>

	<li> If you have any questions, just ask.
</ul>
