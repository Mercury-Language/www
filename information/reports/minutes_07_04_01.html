We had a meeting of the Mercury group on Fri April 7, 2001, at 3.15pm.

Attendees:
       David Jeffery (dgj)
       David Overton (dmo)
       Fergus Henderson (trd)
       Mark Brown (dougl)
       Simon Taylor (stayl)
       Tyson Dowd (trd)
       Zoltan Somogyi (zs)

Progress reports

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing what
	they had been working on recently and/or what they were planning
	to work on.

	Tyson Dowd (trd):
		Has been working on misc fixes on the IL backend.
		Will be leaving for Europe the day after the meeting.

	Mark Brown (dougl)
		Has spent most of his time getting up to speed on .NET.

	David Jeffery (dgj)
		Has been working mostly on HAL stuff.

	David Overton (dmo)
		Has continued work on the constraint based mode analysis
		system. It now handles iota, the classic predicate for
		filling in a partially instantiated data structure.
		It also handles most of the test cases in the benchmark
		directory, but it has performance problems with the relatively
		large number of function symbols in the main type used in the
		deriv test case.

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs)
		Has started performance testing the deep profiler. At the
		moment, turning on deep profiling slows a program does by a
		factor of about 2.6, compared to about a a factor of 2.1 for
		using the debug grade. The overhead is due to instrumentation
		code added to the program and lost optimizations, including
		tail recursion.

		In an effort to reduce the overhead and account for it better,
		Zoltan has refactored the instrumentation predicates, in order
		to avoid redundant entries/exits to instrumentation code. Since
		some of the instrumentation predicates are pragma foreign code
		with determinism failure, he has also improved the code
		generation for such predicates.

		We also discussed ways to manage sessions of user interaction
		with the deep profiling tool.

	Fergus Henderson (fjh)
		Finished the 0.10.1 release. Congratulations!

	Simon Taylor (stayl)
		Has been working on a system that allows the compiler to avoid
		unnecessary recompilations. The idea is to effectively
		associate a time stamp not only with each interface file,
		which we already do, but with each item in interface files.
		This allows the compiler to avoid recompiling a module if
		if none of the items that a module depends have changed since
		the module was last recompiled, even if other items in the
		interface file have changed or been added. This should reduce
		the cost adding a new predicate e.g. to module `list'.

		We discussed ways of checking whether an item has changed or
		not. While comparing cryptographically secure hashes (e.g. MD5)
		may be somewhat faster, psychologically a full comparison
		is more acceptable to most people.
