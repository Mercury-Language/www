1. Progress reports

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing what
	they had been working on recently and/or what they were planning
	to work on.

	Tyson Dowd (trd):
		- Back from Microsoft.
		- The .NET backend now works with .NET Beta 2.
		- Adding support for IL foreign code.
		- Discussed possible improvements to the foreign code
		  implementation. One suggestion was that the language
		  should allow a default Mercury implementation of a
		  predicate to be overridden by a more efficient foreign
		  code implementation depending on the grade and target
		  language.
		- Thesis writing.

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs):
		- Improvements for deep profiling, in particular improving
		  the way profile data is presented to the user.

	Fergus Henderson (fjh):
		- BABEL conference reviewing.
		- Fixed unnecessary casting in the high level C backend.
		- Thought about how Mercury can use Microsoft's codeDOM API.

	Mark Brown (dougl):
		- Working on an IL->IL transformation to allow
		  retry in the .NET debugger.
		- Improved the pretty printer.
		- Fixed a bug in last year's ICFP contest submission.

	Simon Taylor (stayl):
		- Committed smart recompilation.
		- Implementing the `--make' compiler option discussed in
		  earlier meetings.

	David Overton (dmo):
		- Exam marking.

	David Jeffery (dgj):
		- Thesis writing.
