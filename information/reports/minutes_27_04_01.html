We had a meeting of the Mercury group on Fri April 27, 2001,
from 3.15pm to 3.45pm

Attendees:
	Zoltan Somogyi (zs)
	Simon Taylor (stayl)
	Mark Brown (dougl)
	David Overton (dmo)

Progress reports

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing what
	they had been working on recently and/or what they were planning
	to work on.

	Simon Taylor (stayl):
		- Still working on smart recompilation. 

	Mark Brown (dougl):
		- Working on the search strategy for the declarative debugger.
		- Has been using the declarative debugger to debug itself.

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs):
		- Has been working on making the deep profiler more usable.
		- Started merging the deep profiling CVS branch back onto
		  the main branch.
		- Produced a script (tools/cvdd) to perform a diff between two
		  workspaces.
		- Reworked the optimization level handling to avoid invoking
		  the lazy code generator and value numbering. With some
		  recently added optimization passes, the eager code generator
		  produces equally good code with less compilation time.

	David Overton (dmo):
		- Has been fixing performance problems with ROBBDs.

	Fergus Henderson (fjh):
		Didn't attend the meeting, but sent a progress report
		by e-mail:

		- Installed autoconf 2.13 on murlibobo (to fix a problem for
		  Cygwin in the `configure' that we ship with our source
		  distributions).
		- Tested the Mercury compiler on Tru64 5.1 using an Oct 2000
		  snapshot of gcc, since our sysadmins are planning to
		  upgrade murlibobo's CPUs and OS. Happily, it worked fine
		  out-of-the-box.
		- Sent off page for MS TechEd DVD.
		- Sent off long letter to MS regarding VSIP license.
		- Chased up GCC copyright assignment
		  (still not yet resolved, <sigh>).
		- Fixed a bug where the compiler was silently accepting some
		  incorrect code involving typeclasses.
		- A little more work towards eliminating dependencies on
		  Cygwin.
		- Some code reviewing.
